# Orbit - Pi Ecosystem Platform

A dual-purpose platform for the Pi Network where users can earn Pi through micro-tasks and spend it on goods/services in a peer-to-peer marketplace.

## 🌟 Overview

Orbit combines two powerful concepts into one unified platform:

- **🎯 PiTask (MicroJobs)** - Earn Pi by completing tasks or offering services
- **🛒 PiMart (Marketplace)** - Spend Pi on real products and digital goods

This creates a **circular Pi economy** where users can earn Pi and immediately spend it, making Pi truly useful for everyday life.
